#+TITLE: Notes on creating spectral maps from Orion West slit spectra

* TODO New general version of the slit flux calibration and astrometry
+ It would be better to use the [[file:~/Work/OrionTreasury/wfi/][WFI images]] to flux calibrate the spectra
  + As well as being more reliable, this is necessary in the case of some of the LL2 slits, since the Image+slit was taken in [S II] instead of H alpha
+ We will apply it first to the LL2 slits, plus any other odd slits that are lying around
  + With the plan being to add in the original horizontal and vertical slits afterwards
+ As well as flux calibration, it will also help with the offset along the slit


** General policy for the workflow                                 :noexport:
+ The previous version had used org-babel source blocks that read directly from org-mode tables.
  - This is convenient for rapid development
  - But it makes the overall logic hard to follow
  - And hard to share with anyone not using emacs
+ So for this implementation I plan to do the following:
  1. Tangle all python scripts to files
  2. Write all data tables to files
     - Initial input table can be written as TSV from org table
     - Do I use JSON or astropy tables written to TSV, or to FITS or ...?
  3. Do I control it all with a makefile?

** Outline of steps

1. We use the image+slit in order to find the slit reference position
   + The image-spectrum offset along the slit has to be found iteratively through a later step
2. Compare the spectrum profile (=spec=) with a synthetic slit (=image=) on the WFI image
   + Similar to [[id:0B8D02D8-4C57-48A1-8F17-6AD60BFA1A7B][Application to the vertical slits]] and [[id:6CE33437-BC17-49AA-B048-5BACCBB8C99B][Repeat for the horizontal slits]]
   + Find the =jshift= value that best matches up the profiles
   + Find brightness normalization
     + Check for calibration gradients along the slit by plotting =spec/image= against =s= (distance along slit)
       + [2015-09-08 Tue] It appears that the trends are not linear.  They tend to either curve down near the left hand edge, or curve up at the right hand edge, combined with a more linear increase from left to right
       + A cubic would probably capture the behavior well
       + [ ] Fit a chebychev polynomial to the ratio
     + Check for zero point errors by plotting  =spec= against =image=
     + [X] One problem will be disentangling the above two effects, because if there is a strong systematic brightness gradient along the slit then their effects will be degenerate
       + It turns out this is not too difficult in most cases, so long as we assume that the along-slit variation is a low-order polynomial
       + Some slits have a compact region with strong brightness gradients near the middle of the slit, which allows one to clearly see if a zero-point offset is present
   + Write out the slit astrometry and flux calibration to a table, similar to how we did [[id:6BFD88F6-71FD-48D3-B8E4-5FF55A3B3D9D][here]] for the vertical slits and [[id:F6ED03C3-EC32-4444-9746-4E3C2A15CD63][here]] for the horizontal slits 
3. Project the calibrated spectra onto a common spatial grid
   + For different velocity ranges
     + This requires finding the heliocentric correction
   + This is what we already did for the [[id:23C29E96-4471-454E-A463-D365731119C0][vertical]] and [[id:60833550-A462-4F18-86DE-895625FF3E7A][horizontal]] slits
     + We need to generalise this slightly so we can treat any PA (maybe that will work out of the box) and both cases for the dimension order of the spectra files (Y-V, or V-Y)

  I haven't quite decide what is going into this table yet.  
  + It will at least have the dataset (YYYY-MM) and the ids for the image+slit and/or the spectrum.
  + Currently it also has a column for notes, so I can remember what is what.
  + Do I want to add the values if we determine them by hand?
    + Position of slit on image
    + Offset image-spectrum
    + Flux calibration
  + Or alternatively, could we determine all of those automatically?
    + Probably not
:END:
+ This does not have all the slits yet, but it will eventually (I hope)
  + [2015-09-16 Wed] Adding the original horizontal slits 
+ The Notes column is just to remind us of stuff
+ After editing, remember to export the table to file with =C-c t e=
+ [2015-09-04 Fri] Added some new columns:
  - saxis :: dimension along the slit length in IMAGE coordinates (1 for x-axis; 2 for y-axis)
    + This is checked by hand in DS9
  - islit :: pixel position of slit along the perpendicular axis (y-axis for saxis=1, x-axis for saxis=2)
    + This is measured by hand in DS9
  - shift :: pixel offset along the slit between image+slit and spectrum
    + This has to be found by trial and error (from plotting slit profile from spectrum and comparing with synthetic slit)
  - norm :: the factor we divide the spectrum by so that it is equal to the flux calibration image
    + This is for the center of the slit, since we will need to include a polynomial correction term later
    + Also found by trial and error - it does not need to be exact since any inaccuracy will get compensated by the leading term of the Chebyshev fit
  - zero :: Correction to the zero point of the spectra
    - Found by looking at the background in the ha and nii spectra, and a little bit of trial and error so that the upper graph panel of spectrum versus image passes through the origin

*** Different binning between image and spectrum
+ Note that binning along the slit axis differs between image+slit and spectrum for these 2013-12 datasets:
  + 086
  + 090
  + 102
  + 111
+ It is x2 for the image+slit, but x3 for the spectrum
+ This is now dealt with in the [[id:1D9200A9-45BA-4128-894B-4D4DF84FC2F2][find_slit_coords]] function


*** TODO Allow for offsets perpendicular to slit
+ In some cases, the pointing may have drifted in between the image+slit exposure and the spectrum exposure
+ I suspect this is happening with the 2013-12 spectra at least

*** DONE Problems with the flux zero-point of the spectra

  + However, I don't like this approach because there is no check that the "continuum" parts of the spectrum (in between the emission lines) still have a sensible value (at the very least, non-negative!)
+ We can do better.  By looking at vignetted edge of the untrimmed spectra exposures, we can see whether the "continuum" values are real continuum or not.
  + In many cases, it is obvious that there is still a residual constant value that needs to be subtracted
  + For instance, with 2013-12-086 dataset:
    + [[file:~/Dropbox/papers/LL-Objects/SPMDIC13/][file:~/Dropbox/papers/LL-Objects/SPMDIC13/]]
    + The raw spectrum is spm088.fits
    + The reduced spectrum is spm088_bcrx.fits, spec088-ha.fits, spec088-nii.fits
    + Unfortunately, hey are not all the same
      + spm088_bcrx.fits looks like its flux zero point is 16
      + spec088-ha.fits looks like its flux zero point is 11
      + spec088-nii.fits looks like its flux zero point is 12
    + We will try using 11.0
+ So plan is to re-use the =zero= column to be the value that we subtract from the ha and nii spectra pixels *before* summing in wavelength.
+ This works more or less well for 2013-12 and 2010
+ [X] Linear trend in zero-point for 2007-01 LL1 slits
  + The "continuum" goes negative at the N end of the slits
  + This would be best dealt with by modifying the images before using them
  + The problem is seen in all the spectra - it seems to be due to having subtracted the image in superbias.fits, which is obviously wrong, since it has a linear gradient from 1150 to 1230, which is a delta of 80
    + I thing the real value should be about 1160 to 1170
    + So if we map the y-axis onto [0, 1], then we need to add 80*y - 10
    + This is done [[id:4335A38B-52C8-4F0E-8F92-308DC4DBC4F6][below]]
+ Now that we have fixed up the LL1 slits, we still get reasonable calibrations, even when we determine =zero= directly from the spectral images
  + The only problem is that the Bright Bar is slightly less prominent on the spectra than it is on the calibration image
  + It can be largely fixed by pushing =zero= up to about 10
  + This is fine for Ha, but is a bit low for nii in the S end of the slit
  + But the high vel components are in the N end and not seen in nii, so it doesn't matter

*** Package up the slit coordinates for use in a FITS header
We also need to create the WCS keywords so that the slit coordinates can be reconstructed from a FITS header.  The general approach is as follows: 

+ We use the standard FITS notation for axes: i, j
  + i = 1, 2, ... are the world coordinate axes
  + j = 1, 2, ... are the image (data array) coordinate axes
  + Python arrays have the order reversed
  + Reference pixel has =CRPIXj= and =CRVALi=
  + Scale is specified with =CDELTi= and =PCi_j=
    + =CDELTi= has the pixel scale in arcsec and wavelength
    + =PCi_j= just has the rotation matrix according to the PA of the slit
+ The calibrated FITS spectra will be regularized so that the image x-axis (j=1 in FITS parlance) is wavelength, and the image y-axis (j=2) is displacement along slit.
  - Any necessary transpose of the data array is done [[id:C7D141C2-85FF-427D-AF2D-DCC34B14E1A4][in the main loop]]
  - [ ] We could also have a degenerate third image axis that is perpendicular to the slit (dimension of 1 along this axis).  Is this necessary? Is it wise?
+ We use 3 world coordinate axes, even though there are only two true image axes, so we can specify the variation of both RA and Dec along the slit
  - The /provisional/ order of the axes is
    - i = 1 :: Wavelength
    - i = 2 :: RA
    - i = 3 :: Dec
  - This is to have the best mapping between the i and j axis orderings
+ We get all the wavelength info directly from the WCS of the original spectrum
  + [ ] Later, we will want to put it in velocity units, possibly as an alternate WCS axis 
+ We get the celestial coordinate info from the list of =slit_coords=
  + We convert these to =astropy.coord.SkyCoord= form and use the =separation()= and =position_angle()= methods between each pair of adjacent pixels
  + We then check that each pair has the same separation and PA as for the first pair
    + This works fine for the separations using the =np.allclose= default relative tolerance of 1e-5, but for the PAs I had to relax it to 1e-4
    + Then we use the separation to set =CDELTi= values and the PA to set elements of the =PCi_j= matrix
+ We set a load of extra WCS keywords
  + The coordinate types and units
  + The reference frame and date of observations
+ At the end, we calculate the coordinates of the slit pixels using this WCS that we have created
  + In theory these should be the same as the =slit_coords= values that were fed in
  + I see differences of order 0.01 arcsec by the end of the slit
    + Not sure why, but I'm not too worried

** Looking for more external constraints on the [N II]/Ha ratios
We have the ODH values, but they are for large areas.  We could do with some actual images of the [N II]/Ha ratio.


*** WFPC2 mosaic
+ We have the f658n and f656n images
+ We ought to work out the difference in efficiency - use nebulio
  + This would require use of the f547m image too

**** Inferences from the mosaic
+ LL1 region needs correction factor of 1.8
+ Horizontal E slits have correction factor 1.1 at E end to 0.88 in middle
  + Unfortunately, we can't continue to the W end of the slit because the mosaic has fill-in data there
  + But this is (weak) evidence that there may be a gradient in [N II]/Ha along the slits

**** Make a ratio map from f658n and f656n

** TODO Calculate [N II]/Ha ratio and [N II] + Ha sum
+ [2015-09-16 Wed] I suspect that much of the remaining issues with the spectra calibration are down to variations in throughput between [N II] and Ha
+ [ ] We can use the O'Dell & Harris spectrophotometry to tie everything down
  + DS9 region file of the slits [[file:~/Work/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/odell-harris-slits.reg][odell-harris-slits.reg]]
  + Slit D North is the most useful since it is short and overlaps with the vertical 2010 slits
    + It has 6583/6563 = 1.1290/2.8905 = 0.39
    + Our slits there have a raw ratio of about 0.30
      + Correction factor of 1.3
    + But half the slits are obviously lower (what is different about these?)
  + Slit D NE overlaps with horizontal 2013-02 slits
    + It has 6583/6563 = 0.9779/2.8139 = 0.347
    + Our slits show a lot of variation along the length
    + Ranges from 0.25 to 0.35
      + Average correction factor = 1.16
  + Slit 27 W overlaps with horizontal 2013-02 slit
    + It has 6583/6563 = 1.2522/2.9002 = 0.432
    + We see some variation along the length
      + 0.33 at W end
      + 0.3 in middle
      + 0.2 at E end
    + Average correction factor = 1.44
    + This is hard to reconcile with the D north results
  + Slit 27 E
    + 1.0010/2.8700 = 0.35
    + The W end of this section overlaps with the E end of 2013-02 slits
      + where we have ratio = 0.17
      + Correction factor of 0.35/0.17 = 2.06 !!!
    + /but the OH slit is sampling a region where we have no data/
  + Slit D NW
    + Has its E end overlap with W end of 2013-02 slits
    + 1.3658/2.8894 = 0.473 so this is highest ratio yet
    + Our slits give 0.37 around there, and increasing westward
      + Correction factor ~= 0.473/0.37 = 1.28
  + Slit 12 W overlaps with our LL1 slits
    + Has ratio 0.2964/2.8906 = 0.10
    + Our slits have 0.1 there
      + Correction factor of unity?
    + But caution needed since brightest part of the 12 W slit is to the E where we have no data
  + Slit 9-mid overlaps with E end of our 2013-12 slits
    + It has ratio = 0.4899/2.8907 = 0.17
    + Our 2013-12 slits have 0.2 there
      + Correction factor = 0.85
  + Slit 9 W overlaps with middle of our 2013-12 slits
    + 0.4157/2.8907 = 0.14
    + Our 2013-12 slits have 0.313 there
      + Correction factor 0.45
      + This means there is a spurious spatial gradient in [N II]/Ha for the 2013-12 slits 
    + But the 2015 slits have ratio of 0.12 there
      + Correction factor 1.17

* Dealing with the offset between image and spectrum
+ It seems that this is not as constant as I had hoped
  + In the [[id:8685D060-12A9-4E73-B069-11D5315ED8EB][vertical slits]] it varies from 52 to 60 pixels
  + And some slits do not have a reference star to use
+ One solution will be to compare the brightness profiles of the spectrum with that of the slit image
  + For the spectrum, we can sum in wavelength for the entire ha+nii range
  + For the image, we would sum a short width across the slit
+ Then we could either use the cross-correlation, or simple hunting, to find the best offset
+ At the same time, this would give the brightness factor between image and spec
  + We could use this to refine the brightness correction factors

+ Pixel positions of slits (islit in table above) also vary between positions, so I have had to measure all of these
  + They are FITS style 1-based indices
  + The slit width is about 4 pixels
  + But the slit center does not fall on an integer pixel
  + To be safe, we take the 5 pixels: [int(islit) - 3 : int(islit) + 3] 
+ First stab:
  + Read in the images and spectra, and overplot the profiles
  + There are 16 positions now, so we can use a 4 x 4 grid
  + The =bfac= factors are the inter-position image brightness correction factors, calculated [[id:D625BE5F-BE3F-477A-8059-4B0AFEFEED54][below]] - they multiply all the brightnesses
    + On the graphs, I print out =bright = 1/bfac=
    + [2015-08-25 Tue] I am modifying by hand the bfac for 248 from 2.222 to 2.4
      + There is no justification for this, other than that it looks too faint on the maps
  + The =fac= factors are the image-to-spectrum brightness factors - they multiply the image profile so that it matches the spectrum profile
    + So larger factors mean better spectra (compared to what is expected from the image)
    + The most common factor /should/ correspond to equal conditions between image and spectrum. But in general =fac= could be larger or smaller than this.
    + I am assuing that =fac = 4.4= is the default value, and dividing all of them by this when I print the info on the plot
      + There are 4 spectra that have the optimum value of =bfac=:
        + 206, 128, 210, 219
      + Most of the other values are lower
        + This make sense if conditions were deteriorating during the night
        + Then each spectrum is worse than its preceding image
      + But a few are higher, implying improvements since the image:
        + 133, 248, 157, 252
        + These tend to have high values of bfac

+ [2015-08-21 Fri] I have measured the y-pixel position of the slit (=jslit=) on the images - it is roughly constant, but not quite
  + We have to be careful to use the "Image" coordinate, not the "Physical" one
+ The slit width is 150 micron for all exept =029= where it is 70 micron
  + This is reflected in the nominal pixel width of the slit, which is given in the =dj= column
  + The slit profile is not rectangular - looks more triangular, or perhaps an ellipse
+ The bias seems to have been removed, but there is a residual signal in the image+slits of 6 to 12 counts, which varies in J but not in I
  + At the J of the slit it looks to be about 9
+ It is hard to tell whether there is anything that should be removed from the spectra
  + But looking at the x-profiles of the line-free parts of the PV image, as compared with the Ha line, I think there is a residual bias of about 3
  + When multiplied by NY=1017, this gives 3051 as the value that should be subtracted from the y-summed profile
+ I have found a better way to extract the slit profile from the image:
  + Sum over a wide window that includes the /entire/ slit profile
  + But then subtract off the average of the two rows above and below this window, multiplied by the window width
  + This is equivalent to interpolating the bg underneath the slit profile
  + It seems to give better results than the previous method
+ [2015-08-22 Sat] The bright and bgrad columns can now be filled in from the calculation [[id:23506DE2-4D98-40C5-961F-4715BE7A1F55][down here]]
  + Note that *bright is the reciprocal of bfac*, which I used in the table for the vertical slits 
  + The bgrad is for a linear E-W gradient correction to the brightnesses
  + I rounded it to 1 decimal place, since it is not that well determined
+ [2015-08-25 Tue] I redid the calculation of the =bright= factors, see [[id:23506DE2-4D98-40C5-961F-4715BE7A1F55][down here]], so we are now using the =corrnorm= column of the last table

* Datasets that we will use

** Odd slits that we don't want to forget
+ 2007 Jan
  + Some of the LL1 slits show blueshifted emission at their N end
    + spec060-oiii
    + spec055-ha
    + spec068-ha
    + spec073-ha
  + Unfortunately, most of the slits were put too far South to see this
  + The [O III] slits from 2013 Dec Orion S don't quite go far west enough to reach this, and the same is true of the Orion S slits from 2007
+ 2010 Jan
  + spm078 (Ha, [N II])
  + spm085 ([S II])
  + These are vertical slits to the W of LL2 that help fill in that region to the E of the N ends of the other vertical slits
  + They cross the N wing of the putative big bow
    + Clearly redshifted, helping establish continuity with wing seen in LL2 slits
    + Also we can measure the electron density
  + We also cross a bizarre blue-shited feature to WNW of LL2
    + Looks like a classical triangular bowshock shape in the PV diagram
+ 2013 Feb
  + spm024 (Ha, [N II])
  + This is a horizontal slit across LL2 (just N of star)
  + It shows that a blue emission layer stops just in front of the LL2 bow
+ 2013 Dec
  + There is one extra position just below LL2 - spm116
    + Unfortunately, it is low s/n
+ 2015 Feb
  + 0013 and 0003
  + More horizontal slits in the middle part
  + These are similar to the slits from Dec 2013
** Dec 2013
+ These are in [[file:~/Dropbox/papers/LL-Objects/SPMDIC13/][file:~/Dropbox/papers/LL-Objects/SPMDIC13/]]
+ They are horizontal slits in between LL2 and Orion S
** Feb 2015
+ These are in [[file:~/Dropbox/SPMFEB15/][file:~/Dropbox/SPMFEB15/]]
+ They are horizontal slits in between LL2 and Orion S with a new chip
** Jan 2007 and Feb 2006

*** Inter-position brightness calibration
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
+ I have measured brightness in several parts of the image
  + Shown in table below, where *-ed columns are normalised to =226= which seems to be the best
+ There are problems with large-scale brightness gradients in some exposures
  + Particularly E-W
  + I have compared with =219= of the horizontal slits
  + =226= looks fine, but =149= has a clear spurious gradient - falling from W to E
  + =033= and =029= on the other hand have a gradient the other way
  + This is shown in the =W/E= column of the table, which shows the average ratio between the West and East normalizations
  + So we can divide the images into 3 groups:
    + Fine :: 237, 232, 226 (W/E ~= 1)
    + West bias :: 165, 169, 149, 154, 159 (W/E ~= 1.45)
    + East bias :: 033, 029 (W/E ~= 0.8)

+ So to correct the brightness gradients, we use the following:
  + For =149=, we have brightness the same brightness as 226 in the W side, but 0.5 times the brightness in the E side
  + So we will try multiplying by a linear function =(1 + delta*(i - 0.5*NX)/NX)=
  + For this case, we want (1 + 0.5 \delta)/(1 - 0.5 \delta) = 0.5 (remember that i increases from W to E)
    + => 1 + 0.5 \delta = 0.5 - 0.25 \delta => 0.5 = -0.75 \delta => \delta = -2/3
    + This is for a case W/E = 1.54 and it should scale with (W/E - 1)
    + So we get \delta = -1.24 (W/E - 1)
+ The columns "Mean" and "W/E" get copied to columns =bfac= and =bgrad= respectively in the [[id:6CE33437-BC17-49AA-B048-5BACCBB8C99B][table above]]
+ [2015-08-25 Tue] I was not satisfied with the brightness normalizations
  + Some slits, notably 149, 154, 159 seem to be too bright in the combined image
  + So I have remeasured the brightness in a central point (the bright clump just to the W of the nose of the giant bowshock)
  + This gives slightly higher normalizations for those slits
  + *BUT* we also need to account for the affect of the \delta correction on the reference point
    + X0 = NX/2 = 312
    + From the table, the Xpix values of the reference point can be smaller or larger than that
    + So there is a further correction factor dcorr = 1 + \delta (Xpix - X0)/NX, which we have to /multiply/ the brightness norms by
    + I copied the delta values from the table [[id:F6ED03C3-EC32-4444-9746-4E3C2A15CD63][here]]
  + The result is that the corrections are closer to unity for nearly all the slits

: Acabo de terminar las reducciones de las observaciones de Enero. Al
: final nos quedamos con 16 posiciones, eliminé 7 posiciones
: porque las observé con muchas nubes por lo que no obtuve buenos
: resultados, lo bueno fué que en la siguiente noche pude obtener
: estas posiciones o cercanas a ellas. De cualquier manera las reduje
: por si decidimos incluirlas.
: 
: Las reducciones estan en: /fs/tungol/home0/LEEDS/teresa/SPMENE10/reducciones
: 
: incluyo también la bitacora en pdf. Las posiciones que no tomé en
: cuenta para hacer los mapas fueron:
: 
: No incluidas        Slit cercana o casi en la misma posición que la anterior
: spm128                   spm133 (se ve mucho mejor que spm128)
: spm231                   spm248

: 
: Hice la astrometría, las imagen+slit corregidas están en el directorio
: llamado "posiciones" adentro del direcotorio "reducciones"
: También hice dos posiciones al Este de la región observada. Están la
: oeste de HH 505, las observé en Halpha y [S II]:
: spm078 (image+slit), spm085 (image+slit). Podemos obtener la densidad
: en estas posiciones.
: 
: Para la posición de spm219 tomé los espectros en Ha (spm220,221),
: [SII] (spm225,226) y [OIII] (spm228,229)
: Los espectros corregidos en longitud de onda los puse en:
: 
: /fs/tungol/home0/LEEDS/teresa/SPMENE10/observaciones/SPM{ha,nii,siis,siil,oiii}
: 
: Después de hacer todo el trabajo hice el primer intento de los mapas
: de momentos de Halpha y [NII] :D a ver que te parecen,
: todos los archivos  estan en

* Making spectral maps
+ The plan is to start with a fine orthogonal RA-dec grid
  + Place all the slits onto there by looping over slit pixels and painting all the grid pixels that fall in each
  + Leave grid pixels transparent where no slit falls
+ Then do the multi-resolution thing
  + As in [[id:E1B9B2C8-1CDE-407B-B9FE-4E31144F328C][Rebinning the maps]] in orion tsquared notes
  + Which makes use of [[file:~/Work/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/rebin_utils.py][file:~/Work/RubinWFC3/Tsquared/rebin_utils.py]]
+ This should give a map with all the holes filled in at lower resolution
+ To start with we will work with the original spectra that I already have
  + Later, we should switch to the bg-subtracted and brightness-corrected ones that Alba has
** Define the output grid
+ 1 arcsec is
  + 2.778e-4 deg declination
  + 2.765e-4 deg RA
+ We will try a grid with 0.5 arcsec pixels that is 1024 x 1024, which should comfortably enclose all of the slits
+ AR reference of the horizontal slits is 83.6158 +/- 0.0019
  + AR range of vertical slits is 83.6016 to 83.6205: 68 cos(-5.4150) = 67.7 arcsec
+ Dec reference of vertical slits is -5.4150 +/- 0.0006
  + Dec range of horizontal slits is -5.4409 to -5.4155 = 91.44 arcsec
  + Actually Dec value of the vertical slits is a bit lower now that I have taken into account the image-spectrum shift 
+ So we use
  + CRPIX1 = CRPIX2 = 256.5
  + CRVAL1 = 83.61, CRVAL2 = -5.423
  + CDELT1 = -0.5/3600, CDELT2 = 0.5/3600
  + PC1_1 = 1.0, PC1_2 = 0.0
  + PC2_1 = 0.0, PC2_2 = 1.0
+ Note that the WCS matrix should be given in arcdegrees - the translation to degrees of RA is done automatically (and it doesn't matter much anyway, since we are near the equator)

** Test with the velocity-integrated emission

  That did not help at all - we definitely need to rehabilitate slit 248
- Note taken on [2015-08-25 Tue 11:03] \\
  Added the noisy slit 145 to the list of vertical ones to drop.  I am not convinced that this will work out, since with 248 and 145 gone there is a big gap.  It may be possible to rehabilitate 248 with a bit of work - it will probably need its brightness increasing

+ Unfortunately, the weights increase a lot with the binning - more than they ought to.
+ The problem is that the pixels at the finest grid levels are not independent, since many of them come from the same pixel of the slit spectrum
+ However, the algorithm does not know this and so adds them up when it rebins to the next coarser grid

  + => thermal FWHM = sqrt((23.77**2 - 12.76**2) (14/13)) = 20.8 km/s
  + So basically 1e4 K, which is not surprising
* The big bowshock
+ There is a giant, possibly double, possibly triple bow
+ It's N wing crosses LL2, and is red-shifted
  + And has measured proper motion
+ The nose looks red-shifted too
+ It would be good to get proper motions of the nose
* Coordinates of the slits
+ Data received from Alba [2015-08-11 Tue]

** Description from Alba
: Todos los datos están en:
: /fs/posgrado01/other0/albafm/WesternShocks/3.CuboWS/0.Datos
: Diferencio entre especros e imagenes y luego entre los del 2010 (verticales) y
: 2013 (horizontales)
: Todos los espectros tienen la sustraccion del continuo (*nc*) y los del 2010
: además tiene el factor de calidad (aplicado entre ellos y a todos los de esa
: campaña de observacion, son *cc*fits)
: 
: Por ultimo te adjunto tabla las coordenadas de cada posicion de las rendijas.



** Brightness correction factors
+ The 2010 data in =3.CuboWS/0.Datos= are =.nc.cc.= have already had this applied
+ The prior stage (just =.nc.=) is in =2.Datos2010/1.PreparandoDatos/1.SustraccionContinuo=
+ The factors are in [[file:/ssh:nil:/fs/posgrado01/other0/albafm/WesternShocks/2.Datos2010/1.PreparandoDatos/2.IgualandoCalidad/intensidades.dat][intensidades.dat]]
  + Transposed version of this table below
  + The factors multiply the observed intensities
+ The 2013 data don't seem to have any brightness correction

* Proper motions of the Orion West shocks 
+ [2015-08-26 Wed] Today I discovered that there is a new Massimo Robberto program that has re-observed the whole of Orion with the ACS F775W filter
+ And also various bits with the F130N and F139M WFC3 IR filters
+ This will allow us do to proper motion measurements of all the interesting shocks in our field
+ Relevant images are as follows:
  + JCOL02010 for ACS field W of LL2
  + JCOL09010 (ORIMOS-16) for ACS field just below that, containing the nose of the giant bowshock
  + JCOL03010 ACS includes LL2 and region immediately to W
  + ICOL22030 WFC3 IR image of region W of LL2
  + JCOL05010 ACS field of the big gap between trapezium and LL2
  + JCOL11010 ACS way S with filaments along extension of bright bar
+ Missing images

+ Older images that we might use
  + An [S II] WFPC2 image that covers the circular bubble to the S of LL2 plus the upper partial "nose" of the big bowshock: U8OC2604M from Bally's ACS program 9825
  + [X] We should actually get the entire set of these
    + [2015-08-27 Thu] Downloaded to =/fs/nil/other0/will/orion-bally-wfpc2-2004/=
  + There is a interesting bowshock seen in [S II] to the W of the end of HH269, but not quite as W as the flatter bow that we can see in Ha and NIR
    + RA: 05 34 59.81
    + Dec: -05 23 39.94
    + Image: U8OC1804M
  + This could be a candidate for the same flow as the big bowshock
  + We also need to look into possible correspondences with the molecular outflows from Orion S

* Modifying org export to include header arguments                 :noexport:
Based on http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/blog/2014/09/22/Showing-what-data-went-into-a-code-block-on-export/


** This is all copied from John Kitchin's page
Here is how we can get a list of the table-names indicating their name or that they are results (results are enclosed in ()).

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'table
  (lambda (element)     
    (or (org-element-property :name element) (org-element-property :results element))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
- vertical-image-and-fullspec
- ("vertical-all-parameters")
- horizontal-slits
- vertical-slits
- ("")

Similarly, here is the list of parameters for each block.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'src-block
  (lambda (element)     
    (org-element-property :parameters element)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
- :return figfile :results file
- :return table :dir ~/Dropbox/SPMJAN10/reducciones/posiciones :exports both
- :results output
- :results silent
- :results output
- :results silent
- :results output
- :results list


** My attempt to extend it to '#+header:' elements
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'src-block
  (lambda (element)
  (org-element-property :header element)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
- (":var table=vertical-image-and-fullspec")
- (":var intable=vertical-image-and-fullspec")
- (":var vtab=vertical-all-parameters" ":var ignore=positions-to-drop")



** And to named plain lists
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-element-map (org-element-parse-buffer) 'plain-list
  (lambda (element)     
    (or (org-element-property :name element) (org-element-property :results element))))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
- positions-to-drop
- ("")
- ("")
- ("")
